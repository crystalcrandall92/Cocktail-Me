### Description
Cocktail Application is an application that allows a user to explore a database of cocktails and create their own drinks. This application also enables a user to create an account and save their collection of cocktails. Cocktail Application is a platform to demonstrate what our team has learned in class up to this point, and is the first full-stack application we have built on our own. Initially, our team had the idea to build something a little more complex: a Petfinder application with slightly more sophistication and features than the existing Petfinder. However, we found that this was too ambitious after running into some authentication troubles with the Petfinder API. So, we pivoted to a slightly simpler concept that would allow us to focus on the meat of the code.

To navigate Cocktail Application, begin at the home page. This page is an introduction to the application that contains information about its functionality and the collaborators. In the navigation bar at the top of the page, there are several tabs: Search Drink, Create Drink, Your Drinks, and Login or Sign Up. In the Search Drink tab, there are two different fields available for you to enter either a drink name or drink ingredient. Simply click on the magnifying glass icon to search our database for a match. In the Create Drink tab, you can enter a recipe for your own drink. There are fields for spirits, other ingredients, and directions (shaken, stirred, garnishings, et cetera). Click the create button at the bottom of the page to add this recipe to the "Your Drinks" tab. In this tab, a list of the drinks you have created or saved will store locally on your machine. Last, you can either log into an existing account or create a new account under the Log In or Sign Up tab.
